## Nuklear [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/golang-ui/nuklear/nk?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/golang-ui/nuklear/nk)

Package nk provides Go bindings for nuklear.h â€” a small ANSI C gui library. See [github.com/vurtun/nuklear](https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear).<br />
All the binding code has automatically been generated with rules defined in [nk.yml](/nk.yml).

An idiomatic wrapper package isn't coming I guess, because it will require strong interest in further development and I have no time for that now. The `nk` package is fine for the start, then we'll figure out something better that just a wrapper.

### Installation of nk

```bash
$ brew install glfw # must be >= 3.2
$ go get github.com/golang-ui/nuklear/nk
```

### Demo

There is an example app that shows the usage of Nuklear GUI library, based on the official demos.

```bash
$ go get github.com/golang-ui/nuklear/cmd/nk-example

$ nk-example
2016/09/23 23:13:09 glfw: created window 400x500

```

### Rebuilding the package

You will need to get the [cgogen](https://git.io/cgogen) tool installed first.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/golang-ui/nuklear && cd nuklear
$ make clean
$ make
```
